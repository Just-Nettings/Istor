## Network Spyware Program (By jay83)
The Network Spyware Program, developed by jay83, is a powerful C++ application designed to perform various network-related tasks. This program provides a comprehensive set of features for network administrators, developers, or anyone working with network management and security.

## Features

## Port Scanning

## The program includes functionality to check if a specific port is open on a given host.
It enables users to find an open port within a specified range on a host.
Network scanning capabilities allow for identifying open ports within a range on a host or IP range, providing insights into potential vulnerabilities.
Tunneling

## The program facilitates the creation of secure tunnels to localhost using the popular tool called ngrok.
Automatic download and extraction of ngrok ensure a seamless tunneling experience.
File Transfer

## The program offers a convenient method to send files securely through the ngrok tunnel.
Users can specify the file to be sent and the destination path on the server.
Background Process Execution

## The program allows users to run background processes on a connected device through the ngrok tunnel.
Execution commands can be customized to suit specific requirements.
Operating System Compatibility
The Network Spyware Program is designed to be compatible with multiple operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and macOS. The program automatically detects the operating system and executes OS-specific commands accordingly, providing a consistent experience across different platforms.

## Usage and Examples
The program provides a set of functions that can be utilized within your own codebase. Here are some examples of how to use the Network Spyware Program:

Checking if a port is open on a specific host:


bool isOpen = isPortOpen("example.com", 80);
Finding an open port within a range on a specific host:


int openPort = findOpenPort("example.com", 8000, 9000);
Scanning open ports within a range on a given host or IP range:


std::vector<int> openPorts = scanOpenPorts("example.com", 8000, 9000);
Running an OS-specific command:


runCommand("your-command-here");
Refer to the program's documentation or consult the provided source code for further details on function usage and integration into your projects.

Security Considerations
The Network Spyware Program is a powerful tool that should be used responsibly and with caution. It is important to comply with applicable laws and regulations while using this program. Ensure that you have proper authorization and permissions before scanning or accessing any network resources. The program itself is not intended for malicious purposes, and its usage should strictly adhere to ethical guidelines.
